# Share and seek

This app can help you find you need,if you find a nice restaurant and want to share it with others,you can upload it as a service,then
other people will see it.You can also leave your rating ,comments and photos here as a feedback.And if you want to seek a good place like bars or café，you
can find them here.You can sort the results by your preference and make a wise decision. 

If you are enthusiastic and want to offer some unprofitable help like hitchhiking , you can do it here.And you can also post your troubles that you can't deal with,and see if some one can help you.
I believe that helping makes a better life,so it motivates me to develop this app :)
